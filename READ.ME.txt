?? Retail Operations & Logistics Audit (SQL)
?? Project Overview
In a modern retail environment, data is rarely stored in a single file. This project simulates a professional Relational Database environment using SQLite.

The goal was to act as a Lead Data Analyst to audit company operations, bridge the gap between "Customer" and "Sales" tables, and provide actionable insights for the Logistics and Marketing departments.

??? Tech Stack & Skills
Database Engine: SQL (SQLite3)

Environment: Python (used as the execution bridge via sqlite3 and pandas)

Core SQL Techniques: * Relational Joins: Connecting disparate tables to create a unified data view.

Conditional Logic: Automating business rules via CASE statements.

Data Cleaning: Standardizing "noisy" text and financial inputs using string and math functions.

Aggregation: Calculating KPIs like total revenue and city-wise performance.

?? Database Architecture
The analysis is built on two primary tables:

sales: Contains transactional data (Order IDs, Product Names, Prices, and Quantities).

customers: Contains demographic data (Customer Names and Geographic Locations).

SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    c.city,
    UPPER(s.product_name) AS product_clean,
    ROUND(s.price * s.quantity, 2) AS total_order_value,
    CASE 
        WHEN (s.price * s.quantity) >= 1000 THEN '?? Urgent / VIP'
        WHEN (s.price * s.quantity) >= 500 THEN '? High Priority'
        ELSE 'Standard'
    END AS shipping_priority
FROM sales AS s
JOIN customers AS c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_order_value DESC;

?? Key Business Insights
Ghost Customer Identification: Used LEFT JOIN logic to identify users who registered but haven't placed an order, providing a target list for marketing re-engagement.

Geographic Performance: Aggregated sales by city to identify Mumbai and Delhi as high-growth regions.

Operational Efficiency: Automated the "Priority Level" flagging, which reduces manual decision-making for the warehouse team by 100%.
